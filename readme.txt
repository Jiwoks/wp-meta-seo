WP Meta SEO give you the control over all your meta in your article and images. In one view you will be able to add some meta, alt tag and resize photos.


== Description ==

It was so annoying before and almost nobody was able to change all content and image meta. 
WP Meta SEO is going to list all articles, pages, custom post and all images. Update meta and image size and everything is AJAX saved.

You can now optimize the size of your images in articles. A bunch of people reduce the size of the pictures handling the border and resizing in html/css.
